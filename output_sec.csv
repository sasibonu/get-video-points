00:00:00,00:00:01, [door squeaks]
00:00:01,00:00:03, [gasps]
00:00:03,00:00:06," - Oh my god, Architectural Digest."
00:00:06,00:00:07, It's been a long time.
00:00:08,00:00:09, I've missed you.
00:00:12,00:00:13, You wanna come in?
00:00:13,00:00:16, [upbeat music]
00:00:20,00:00:21," All right, welcome."
00:00:21,00:00:24, This is the foyer area.
00:00:24,00:00:26," In New York City apartments,"
00:00:26,00:00:28, I assume you've seen New York City apartments.
00:00:28,00:00:29, I don't know if you live in Manhattan
00:00:29,00:00:31, but I live in Manhattan
00:00:31,00:00:34," and in general our apartments are very, very small"
00:00:34,00:00:35, compared to the rest of the world.
00:00:35,00:00:39, My foyer is about two feet by two feet.
00:00:39,00:00:42, This is a little thing that you put on the wall
00:00:42,00:00:43, where you have a bunch of pens.
00:00:43,00:00:45, I think I've used this once
00:00:45,00:00:48, in the year and a half I've been living here.
00:00:49,00:00:51, And you write things on it.
00:00:51,00:00:52, You know what I mean?
00:00:52,00:00:53, You're suppose to write things on it
00:00:53,00:00:55, like inspirational things
00:00:55,00:00:58," or like little love notes to yourself,"
00:00:58,00:00:59," positive quotes, things like that."
00:00:59,00:01:00, I don't do that.
00:01:00,00:01:03, [upbeat music]
00:01:05,00:01:06," So, this is the bookcase."
00:01:06,00:01:08, This is sort of the piece de resistance
00:01:08,00:01:10, or one of them in the very small apartment here.
00:01:10,00:01:12," Oh, this is embarrassing."
00:01:12,00:01:15," Look, the ""Stranger Things"" book is like front and center."
00:01:15,00:01:16, That's so embarrassing.
00:01:16,00:01:18," But also so is two copies on ""Don Quijote""."
00:01:18,00:01:20, Neither of which I've read.
00:01:20,00:01:21, I like this bookcase a lot.
00:01:21,00:01:23, It's got these little things.
00:01:23,00:01:25," I think my designer, Kyle,"
00:01:25,00:01:27," we'll be talking about Kyle a bunch this tour,"
00:01:27,00:01:28," Kyle calls these,"
00:01:28,00:01:30," I think they're called god lights or something,"
00:01:30,00:01:32," which I don't,"
00:01:32,00:01:34, maybe it because it makes the bookcase look angelic
00:01:34,00:01:35, or something like that.
00:01:35,00:01:38," This is a nice little ladder thing,"
00:01:38,00:01:40," which slides along the wall,"
00:01:40,00:01:42, which I think is super cool.
00:01:42,00:01:46, I only use it to get to my MTV Movie award
00:01:46,00:01:47," that I won for ""Stranger Things"","
00:01:47,00:01:48," which by the way,"
00:01:48,00:01:52, is the worst made award in the history of awards.
00:01:52,00:01:55, As you can see it's completely falling apart.
00:01:56,00:01:59, And it did that on day three of my having it.
00:01:59,00:02:02, [upbeat music]
00:02:04,00:02:05," All right, I'll tell you a little bit"
00:02:05,00:02:07, about the story of this apartment.
00:02:07,00:02:12," So, I came in here with this amazing designer architect guy"
00:02:13,00:02:15, and we sort of re-envisioned the whole thing.
00:02:15,00:02:17," So, we put in this wall."
00:02:17,00:02:20, I love these like pocket door things or whatever.
00:02:20,00:02:22, See this little like fancy handle thing?
00:02:22,00:02:25, It just kind of disappears into the wallpaper.
00:02:25,00:02:26, It's so awesome.
00:02:26,00:02:28, I love this wallpaper too.
00:02:28,00:02:32, It's got some leopards and tigers and stuff.
00:02:32,00:02:34, None of these animals would really co-exist
00:02:34,00:02:37, this close proximity in the wild
00:02:37,00:02:38," but, you know, it's wallpaper."
00:02:38,00:02:39, It's not real life.
00:02:39,00:02:42, [upbeat music]
00:02:42,00:02:45," So, this is, basically, like the room"
00:02:45,00:02:46, where you live in.
00:02:46,00:02:50, There's no like den or study or things like that.
00:02:50,00:02:51," It's, basically, one room."
00:02:51,00:02:54," So, this is the kitchen table."
00:02:54,00:02:55, I really love this table.
00:02:55,00:03:00, It's like an old kind of like farm house table we found.
00:03:00,00:03:02, And then we re-designed the whole kitchen as well.
00:03:02,00:03:03, And it was funny.
00:03:03,00:03:05," When you re-design something,"
00:03:05,00:03:09," I found this stove, even though I'm not much of a cook."
00:03:09,00:03:13, I like the color of this stove a lot
00:03:13,00:03:15, and I just thought it was a really cool stove.
00:03:15,00:03:17," And then I was like, wow,"
00:03:17,00:03:19, that stove is a very specific green
00:03:19,00:03:23, and now I have to design like an entire kitchen color scheme
00:03:23,00:03:26, around this particular weird green of the stove.
00:03:26,00:03:28," As you can see, there's like a rail up there too,"
00:03:28,00:03:30," which is where that ladder that was on the bookcase,"
00:03:30,00:03:31, it can come up here too
00:03:31,00:03:34, and you can get into those shelves up there.
00:03:34,00:03:36, [upbeat music]
00:03:38,00:03:40, When you live in loft apartments like this
00:03:40,00:03:43," there is a majestic quality to the height of the ceilings,"
00:03:43,00:03:44, which I really like.
00:03:44,00:03:46," And so, I wanted to build something"
00:03:46,00:03:50, where there was kind of cordoned off office section
00:03:50,00:03:54, but also that kind of showcased the fact that this was high.
00:03:54,00:03:57, And I like a lot of plants
00:03:57,00:04:00," because my old place, I could never maintain plants."
00:04:00,00:04:04," So, this place has light and it's bigger"
00:04:04,00:04:05," and so I can put a lot of plants in it,"
00:04:05,00:04:06, which is great.
00:04:06,00:04:09, Just makes the space feel more alive.
00:04:09,00:04:12, This is one of my most prized possessions.
00:04:12,00:04:13, It was a gift.
00:04:13,00:04:15," It's ""Masters of the Universe"","
00:04:15,00:04:17, which was a film that was made
00:04:17,00:04:19," late '80s early '90s, or something."
00:04:19,00:04:21, But it has Frank Langella
00:04:21,00:04:24," in a ton of prosthetics as Skeletor,"
00:04:24,00:04:25, which I heard him interviewed as
00:04:25,00:04:28, he considers one of his greatest roles of all time.
00:04:28,00:04:31, And I just like that fact that a really great actor
00:04:31,00:04:33, that I admire could do a film
00:04:33,00:04:36, in full prosthetics that wasn't received very well.
00:04:36,00:04:39, [upbeat music]
00:04:40,00:04:42, This is the living area.
00:04:42,00:04:45, And we have this designed for the space.
00:04:45,00:04:46, I love this color.
00:04:46,00:04:48, It's made of this nice soft material.
00:04:48,00:04:49, Couches are hard.
00:04:49,00:04:50, Couches are hard to find.
00:04:50,00:04:51, A good couch that you enjoy sitting on
00:04:51,00:04:54, has always been the bane of my existence.
00:04:54,00:04:58, I've had some very bad couches in my time on this earth.
00:04:58,00:05:00," So, there's no TV."
00:05:00,00:05:02, What I don't watch TV?
00:05:02,00:05:03, Of course I watch TV.
00:05:03,00:05:05, What do you want to watch?
00:05:05,00:05:06, Wanna watch some Netflix?
00:05:06,00:05:07," Come on, let's do this."
00:05:09,00:05:11, There's a projector up there.
00:05:11,00:05:13, But this is great.
00:05:14,00:05:17, You can watch whatever you want.
00:05:17,00:05:20, We could watch the Great British Baking Show.
00:05:20,00:05:21, You guys probably don't have time.
00:05:21,00:05:24, [upbeat music]
00:05:24,00:05:26, I think this is pretty cool.
00:05:26,00:05:30," So, there's a public theater in New York City,"
00:05:30,00:05:31, which is Shakespeare in the Park.
00:05:31,00:05:35," And so, they did a revival reading of ""Romeo and Juliet"""
00:05:35,00:05:40, with Meryl Streep as Juliet and Kevin Kline as Romeo
00:05:41,00:05:43, and Chris Walken as Mercutio.
00:05:43,00:05:45, And there's yours truly.
00:05:45,00:05:47, And I had like two lines.
00:05:47,00:05:49, I think I played like a page.
00:05:49,00:05:51, But I'm happy to play a page in that company.
00:05:53,00:05:54, This is exciting.
00:05:54,00:05:55, You'll see that in May.
00:05:55,00:05:58, [upbeat music]
00:05:59,00:06:00," So, the bedroom."
00:06:00,00:06:03," Again, it's like fairly simple."
00:06:03,00:06:07, It's just a place to sleep and maybe read a book
00:06:07,00:06:09, and maybe do some Pilates.
00:06:09,00:06:11, There's three closets over here.
00:06:11,00:06:12, Those are really cool.
00:06:12,00:06:13, Again they have these things
00:06:13,00:06:15, where it's like you open the door
00:06:15,00:06:16, and the light comes on.
00:06:16,00:06:18, New York living can be kind of hard
00:06:18,00:06:20, because there's always light around.
00:06:20,00:06:22, Like the city never gets dark.
00:06:22,00:06:24," But this,"
00:06:24,00:06:27, these windows I have these black out things put in.
00:06:27,00:06:29, And I'll show you.
00:06:30,00:06:33, We'll just pause and watch the windows go down.
00:06:33,00:06:35," Sometimes I'll do this all day,"
00:06:35,00:06:36," just up and down,"
00:06:36,00:06:37, watch the windows go down.
00:06:37,00:06:38, [gasps]
00:06:38,00:06:39, Oh wait.
00:06:39,00:06:41," Oh my god, this candle."
00:06:41,00:06:43, Tragedy averted.
00:06:43,00:06:44, Woo.
00:06:44,00:06:45, You do have to be careful about that.
00:06:45,00:06:48, [upbeat music]
00:06:49,00:06:52," So, the last part is the bathroom."
00:06:52,00:06:54," You know, sometimes these Manhattan apartments"
00:06:54,00:06:57, they sell them for more you'd call it a two bathroom.
00:06:57,00:06:59," And so, this was two bathrooms."
00:06:59,00:07:03, And they were just two bathrooms right on top of each other
00:07:03,00:07:07," with you know, two toilets and one of them had a shower."
00:07:07,00:07:09, It was ridiculous.
00:07:09,00:07:11," So, we came in, we tore all that down."
00:07:11,00:07:14," We built these closets then we built this bathroom,"
00:07:14,00:07:15, which I really love.
00:07:15,00:07:17, This is a steam shower.
00:07:17,00:07:19," We found this tile, which I really like."
00:07:19,00:07:21," I mean, one of the ideas, I guess, behind the bathroom"
00:07:21,00:07:23, was that it doesn't have a window in it.
00:07:23,00:07:26," And we were like, if it's not gonna have a window,"
00:07:26,00:07:28, why not embrace that and make it
00:07:28,00:07:32," kind of like this spa type feel,"
00:07:32,00:07:36, like you're almost sort of in this spa.
00:07:36,00:07:39," This is where the toilet is, little room with the toilet."
00:07:39,00:07:41," This wallpaper, I think, is really cool."
00:07:41,00:07:44, It's got a lot of like New York scenes to it.
00:07:44,00:07:45," And then, I think this is really cool."
00:07:45,00:07:48, There's like this vaulted ceiling
00:07:48,00:07:53, that Kyle designed so it feels like some odd cathedral.
00:07:54,00:07:57, I also like a really big bath tub
00:07:57,00:07:58, and I've never had one
00:07:58,00:08:01," because I lived in tiny, tiny New York apartments"
00:08:01,00:08:02," and I'm a big guy,"
00:08:02,00:08:03, so it's kind of funny
00:08:03,00:08:06," to have me squished into a small bathtub,"
00:08:06,00:08:08, which I have for most of my life.
00:08:08,00:08:09, And it has four taps.
00:08:09,00:08:11, Everybody who always comes in here
00:08:11,00:08:12," is always like, four taps?"
00:08:12,00:08:14, Why four taps?
00:08:14,00:08:16, It's like why not four taps?
00:08:16,00:08:18," I don't understand why everyone gets so,"
00:08:18,00:08:20," but you can, you know, turn them all on"
00:08:20,00:08:22, and it fills up very quickly.
00:08:22,00:08:23, I love this bathroom.
00:08:23,00:08:24, I think it's great.
00:08:24,00:08:27," And I don't want to throw Kyle under the bus,"
00:08:27,00:08:28," my architect designer,"
00:08:28,00:08:31, who's fantastic and who design this thing.
00:08:31,00:08:31, I love him.
00:08:31,00:08:33, We knew you guys were coming today.
00:08:33,00:08:36, It was a lie when I pretended
00:08:36,00:08:38, like I didn't know that you were coming.
00:08:38,00:08:39, We knew you were coming
00:08:39,00:08:41," and so we art directed a little bit of the apartment,"
00:08:41,00:08:46, one of which is Kyle likes these candelabras.
00:08:46,00:08:48, And we put these big candelabras.
00:08:48,00:08:49, I don't want you to think
00:08:49,00:08:52, that I'm a big candelabra bathtub type guy.
00:08:52,00:08:54, [upbeat music]
00:08:57,00:08:59," Architectural Digest, thank you for coming"
00:09:00,00:09:01, [paper tears]
00:09:01,00:09:02, I'll give you that.
00:09:03,00:09:04, Take that.
00:09:04,00:09:05, Enjoy the rest of your day.
00:09:09,00:09:11, [upbeat music]
00:09:14,00:09:15, - Hi guys.
00:09:15,00:09:16, - Hello.
00:09:16,00:09:17," - Hi, AD."
00:09:17,00:09:18, - I'm Scott Disick.
00:09:18,00:09:19, - I'm Margo.
00:09:19,00:09:20, - I'm Maria Sharapova.
00:09:20,00:09:22, - This is Alphie Dumbledore Delaby.
00:09:22,00:09:23, - Welcome to our home.
00:09:23,00:09:24, - Come on in.
00:09:24,00:09:25, - Welcome to my house tour.
00:09:25,00:09:26, - Welcome to my fazenda.
00:09:26,00:09:27, - Should we let them in?
00:09:27,00:09:28, Yes or no?
00:09:28,00:09:29, No?
00:09:29,00:09:30," Well, what are we gonna do for the rest of the afternoon?"
00:09:30,00:09:33, [upbeat music]
00:09:37,00:09:40, - Makes me feel really zen and relaxed.
00:09:40,00:09:44," - Everything is just sturdy and funky and cool,"
00:09:44,00:09:45, like me.
00:09:45,00:09:47," - Basically, just water, Gatorade and ginger ale."
00:09:47,00:09:48, And matzo ball soup
00:09:48,00:09:50, because everybody's sick in the house.
00:09:50,00:09:51, - This room is so bright
00:09:51,00:09:53, that I have to put a protective force field around me
00:09:53,00:09:55, because it burns my skin.
00:09:55,00:09:57," - I love anything that sparkles, that shines,"
00:09:57,00:09:59," that glitters, that steals the show."
00:09:59,00:10:01, [upbeat music]
00:10:04,00:10:05, - Hope you had a beautiful time.
00:10:05,00:10:07, Ciao.
00:10:07,00:10:07, Come one.
00:10:08,00:10:09, Let's go.
00:10:09,00:10:10, Come on.
00:10:10,00:10:13, [upbeat music]
